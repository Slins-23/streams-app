## DEPRECATED (Websites have updated and thus the updates need to be accounted for in the code)

This app connects to a Python backend. The is hosted at Heroku, <a href="https://hub-stream.herokuapp.com/api">here</a>.
Simple Flutter app connected to a Python backend, which scrapes some streaming websites and returns results which are then displayed in the app.
Made for my newly bought Fire TV Stick, for ease of access.

Works for mobile, but is obviously unoptimized for any platform, meaning there will probably be bugs, UI overflows, etc.

### This app was made for learning purposes, has many things that need improvement, redundant code, etc. Although I know exactly   what should be fixed/Improved, I don't intend to update this in the near future.
