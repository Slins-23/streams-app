# Streams App

## This app connects to a Python backend. In my case, the API I made is hosted at Heroku, <a href="https://hub-stream.herokuapp.com/api">here</a>.

Simple Flutter app connected to a Python backend, which scrapes some streaming websites and returns results which are then displayed in the app.
Made for my newly bought Fire TV Stick, for ease of access.

Works for mobile, but is obviously unoptimized for these platforms, meaning there will probably be bugs, UI overflows, etc.

### This app was made for personal use, has many things that need improvement, redundant code, etc. Although I know exactly   what should be fixed/Improved, I don't intend to update this in the near future.
